## Setting Up Your Python Coding Environment
### Disclaimer
This is of course just a recommendation, we don't want anyone to feel pressured to change their trusted configuration. But if you want to replicate what you'll see in **Module 2**, here's how to do it.
  


## Overview
Recent changes in best practices for using Python have led to a shift from Anaconda to Visual Studio Code (VS Code) for Jupyter notebooks. This guide will help you set up your coding environment for a seamless experience during our workshop.

#### This is why we switched to VS Code:
1. **Better Virtual Environment Management**: VS Code offers superior virtual environment management compared to Anaconda.
2. **Free Access**: Anaconda is now only free for individuals and small organizations, making VS Code a more accessible option.
3. **Integrated Development**: VS Code integrates well with Git and other tools, providing a comprehensive development environment.

### Steps to Set Up Your Environment

#### 1. Install Python, Git, and Visual Studio Code
- **Python**: Download and install the latest version from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **Git**: Download and install Git from the [official Git website](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- **Visual Studio Code**: Download and install VS Code from the [official VS Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

#### 2. Install the Jupyter Notebook Extension in VS Code
- Open VS Code.
- Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window.
- Search for "Jupyter" and install the Jupyter extension.

#### 3. Clone the Workshop Repository
- Open a terminal in VS Code.
- Navigate to the folder where you want to download the workshop contents.
- Run the following command to clone the repository:
  ```bash
  git clone <repository-url>
  ```
  Replace `<repository-url>` with the URL of the workshop repository.

#### 4. Create a Virtual Environment
- In the terminal, navigate to the cloned repository folder.
- Run the following command to create a virtual environment:
  ```bash
  python -m venv .venv
  ```
  This will create a virtual environment named `.venv`.

#### 5. Activate the Virtual Environment
- **Windows**:
  ```bash
  .\env\Scripts\activate
  ```
- **Mac/Linux**:
  ```bash
  source env/bin/activate
  ```

#### 6. Install Required Libraries
- Ensure you are in the virtual environment.
- Run the following command to install the required libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
  
#### 7. .gitignore
To avoid unnecessary content being committed to your repository, make sure to include a `.gitignore` file.

- **Unsafe content**: This includes sensitive information such as API keys and passwords. These should never be committed to your repository.
- **Unnecessary content**: This includes files and directories generated by your development environment, such as virtual environment packages. These should be installed using the `requirements.txt` file.

A basic `.gitignore` file might look like this:
    ```bash
    # Ignore all hidden files and directories
    .*
    ```


## Advanced: Managing Python Versions with pyenv
For those who need to work with multiple Python versions, pyenv is a powerful tool that allows you to easily switch between versions on a per-project basis. Here's how to set it up:

### Setup Guide
#### macOS and Linux

1. Install pyenv:
```bash
# macOS
brew install pyenv

# Linux
curl https://pyenv.run | bash
```

2. Add to your shell configuration file (.bashrc, .zshrc, etc.):
```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.pyenv/bin:$PATH"
eval "$(pyenv init -)"
eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)"
```

3. Restart your shell or run source ~/.bashrc (or equivalent).

#### Windows

1. Install pyenv-win:
```bash
Invoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win/master/pyenv-win/install-pyenv-win.ps1" -OutFile "./install-pyenv-win.ps1"; &"./install-pyenv-win.ps1"
```

2. Add System Environment Variables:

 - PYENV: %USERPROFILE%\.pyenv\pyenv-win
 - PYENV_HOME: %USERPROFILE%\.pyenv\pyenv-win
 - Add to PATH: %PYENV%\bin;%PYENV%\shims

3. Restart your terminal.

### Usage (all platforms)

1. Install a Python version:
```bash
Copypyenv install 3.9.0
```

2. Set a global Python version:
```bash
Copypyenv global 3.9.0
```

3. Set a local (project-specific) Python version:
```bash
Copycd your-project
pyenv local 3.9.0
```

4. Verify the active Python version:
```bash
Copypython --version
```

pyenv allows you to manage Python versions efficiently across different projects, ensuring consistency and avoiding conflicts between different Python installations.



## Conclusion
Following these steps will ensure you have a well-configured environment for coding, making it easier to manage dependencies and work on projects efficiently. Happy coding!

## Managing Python Versions with pyenv

To manage Python versions on a folder level, you can use **pyenv**. This tool allows you to switch between multiple versions of Python easily and set specific versions for different projects. Here's how to set it up on Windows, macOS, and Linux:

### Installation

#### macOS
1. Install pyenv using Homebrew:
    ```sh
    brew install pyenv
    ```

#### Linux
1. Install pyenv using the pyenv-installer:
    ```sh
    curl https://pyenv.run | bash
    ```

#### Windows
1. Install pyenv-win:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win.git %USERPROFILE%\.pyenv
    ```

### Shell Configuration

Add the following lines to your shell configuration file (e.g., `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, or `~/.profile` for macOS and Linux, and `~/.bash_profile` for Windows):

```sh
export PATH="$HOME/.pyenv/bin:$PATH"
eval "$(pyenv init --path)"
eval "$(pyenv init -)"
```
