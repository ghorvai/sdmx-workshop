## Setting Up Your Python Coding Environment
### Disclaimer
This is of course just a recommendation, we don't want anyone to feel pressured to change their trusted configuration. But if you want to replicate what you'll see in **Module 2**, here's how to do it.

### Overview
*Recent changes in best practices for using Python have led to a shift from Anaconda to Visual Studio Code (VS Code) for Jupyter notebooks. This guide will help you set up your coding environment for a seamless experience during our workshop.*

*[Using Git with Visual Studio Code (Official Beginner Tutorial)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_23KUAEtUM&ab_channel=VisualStudioCode)*

#### *This is why we switched to VS Code:*
*1. **Better Virtual Environment Management**: VS Code offers superior virtual environment management compared to Anaconda.*
*2. **Free Access**: Anaconda is now only free for individuals and small organizations, making VS Code a more accessible option.*
*3. **Integrated Development**: VS Code integrates well with Git and other tools, providing a comprehensive development environment.*

### Steps to Set Up Your Environment

#### 1. Install Python, Git, and Visual Studio Code
- **Python**: Download and install the latest version from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **Visual Studio Code**: Download and install VS Code from the [official VS Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- (*Optional**) **Git**: Download and install Git from the [official Git website](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

\**As an alternative to installing Git, you can download the entire repository directly from GitHub:*
- *Navigate to [https://github.com/ghorvai/sdmx-workshop](https://github.com/ghorvai/sdmx-workshop) and download the repository by clicking the green `< > Code` button and selecting `Download ZIP` from the dropdown menu:*
![Download from GitHub](images/download_from_github.jpg)
- *Unzip the downloaded file into a folder of your choice.*
- *Open VSCode.*
- *Open the folder by selecting **File > Open Folder...** from the menu bar.*

*You can now skip **step 3. Clone the Workshop Repository**.*

#### 2. Install the Jupyter Notebook Extension in VS Code
- Open VS Code.
- Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the left side of the window.
- Search for "Jupyter" and install the Jupyter extension.

#### 3. Clone the Workshop Repository
- Open a terminal in VS Code by selecting **View > Terminal** from the menu bar.
- Navigate to the folder where you want to download the workshop contents.
- Run the following command to clone the repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/ghorvai/sdmx-workshop.git
  ```
- Open the folder by selecting **File > Open Folder...** from the menu bar.

#### 4. Create a Virtual Environment
- In the terminal, navigate to the cloned repository folder if you are not already there.
- Run the following command to create a virtual environment:
  ```bash
  python -m venv .venv
  ```
  This will create a virtual environment named `.venv`.

#### 5. Activate the Virtual Environment
- **Windows**:
  ```bash
  .\.venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- **Mac/Linux**:
  ```bash
  source ./.venv/bin/activate
  ```

#### 6. Install Required Libraries
- In the terminal, ensure you're in the virtual environment by checking for the `(.venv)` prefix before the command line.
- Run the following command to install the required libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

#### 7. Set Up Environment Variables

- Set up `.env` file in the **project root** and also in the `chat_bot` folder by copying the `.env.example` files and renaming them to `.env`.
- Fill in the `OPENAI_API_KEY` in the `.env` file in the `chat_bot` folder like so:
  ```bash
  OPENAI_API_KEY=your_open_ai_api_key_here
  ```

### Using the environment for the Jupyter notebooks

- In VSCode, go to the Explorer view by clicking on the Explorer icon in the Activity Bar on the left side of the window.
- Navigate to the `workshop_notebooks` folder and select any Jupyet notebook file with the `.ipynb` extension.
- You may need to select a kernel, if you have not already done so:
  - Click the `Select Kernel` button in the upper right corner of the notebook. In the pop-up menu, select `Python Environments...` element:
  ![Download from GitHub](images/select_kernel.jpg)
  - Select `‚òÖ .venv` (likely the first entry) from the list.
- You can now run the notebook cells. üéâ
