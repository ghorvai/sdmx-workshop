PLAN:
1. finalize the script of the current presentation
 - go through all notebooks & export requirements
 - script the whole thing

2. solve the secretes management
 - change virtualenv from .env to .venv
 - store secrets in .env
 - use dotenv to read environment vars in (replacing load_secrets.py)

3. figure out the use of sdmx1 to substitute my bespoke solution... (include some of that logic in the notebooks)
