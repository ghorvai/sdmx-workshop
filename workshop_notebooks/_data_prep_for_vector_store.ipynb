    "# Understanding the Data Structure Code\n",
    "\n",
    "This code takes complex information about an education dataset and reorganizes it to make it searchable in a vector database. Let's break down what it does:\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Main Function: `flatten_info`\n",
    "This function acts like a coordinator - it calls all the other functions and combines their results into one list. Think of it as a recipe that follows several steps to prepare the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: Names and Descriptions (`flatten_name_and_description`)\n",
    "- Takes the table's name and description\n",
    "- Creates pairs of questions and answers about them\n",
    "- For example, if someone asks \"What's the table's name?\", it can find the answer\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2: Column Information (`flatten_dimensions`)\n",
    "- For each column code (like 'REF_AREA'), it creates explanations about what that code means\n",
    "- Makes it easy to answer questions like \"What does REF_AREA mean?\" (Answer: \"Reference area\")\n",
    "- Also works in reverse: \"What's the code for Reference area?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 3: Code Meanings (`flatten_codes`)\n",
    "- Takes all the special codes in the dataset and creates explanations for them\n",
    "- For example, if someone asks \"What does 'AUS' mean in the REF_AREA column?\", it can answer \"Australia\"\n",
    "- Also works backwards: \"What's the code for Australia?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 4: Structure Questions (`get_dataflow_struct_questions`)\n",
    "- Creates answers for general questions about the dataset\n",
    "- Handles two main types of questions:\n",
    "  1. \"What columns are in this table?\"\n",
    "  2. \"What are all the possible values in a specific column?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The code creates pairs of questions and answers that can be stored in a vector database, making it easy to search and find information about the dataset later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like creating a detailed index for a textbook, where you can quickly look up any term or concept and find the relevant information."
